# Testing in Go

## Introduction

Testing is a crucial part of software development, ensuring that your code behaves as expected and meets the requirements. Go provides a built-in testing framework that makes it easy to write and run tests. This tutorial will cover the fundamentals of testing in Go, including how to write unit tests, use test cases, run benchmarks, and organize your tests effectively.

## The Testing Package

Go's testing framework is provided by the `testing` package, which includes functions and types for writing tests. The primary function for running tests is `TestMain`, and individual test functions must start with the prefix `Test`.

### Example: Basic Test Function

Here's a simple example of a test function:

```go
package mathutil

import "testing"

// Add returns the sum of two integers
func Add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

// TestAdd tests the Add function
func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
    result := Add(2, 3)
    expected := 5
    if result != expected {
        t.Errorf("Add(2, 3) = %d; want %d", result, expected)
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a function `Add` that adds two integers. The `TestAdd` function tests the `Add` function by checking if the result matches the expected value. If the result is not as expected, it calls `t.Errorf` to report the failure.

## Running Tests

To run tests in Go, you can use the `go test` command. This command will automatically find and run all test functions in the current package.

### Example: Running Tests

1. Save the above code in a file named `mathutil.go`.
2. Create a test file named `mathutil_test.go` with the test function.
3. Run the tests using the following command:

```bash
go test
```

You should see output indicating whether the tests passed or failed.

## Table-Driven Tests

Table-driven tests are a common pattern in Go testing. This approach allows you to define a set of test cases in a table (slice) and iterate over them, making it easy to add new test cases without duplicating code.

### Example: Table-Driven Tests

```go
package mathutil

import "testing"

// Multiply returns the product of two integers
func Multiply(a, b int) int {
    return a * b
}

// TestMultiply tests the Multiply function using table-driven tests
func TestMultiply(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        a, b     int
        expected int
    }{
        {2, 3, 6},
        {4, 5, 20},
        {0, 10, 0},
        {-1, 1, -1},
    }

    for _, test := range tests {
        result := Multiply(test.a, test.b)
        if result != test.expected {
            t.Errorf("Multiply(%d, %d) = %d; want %d", test.a, test.b, result, test.expected)
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `TestMultiply` function uses a table of test cases to verify the behavior of the `Multiply` function. Each test case includes input values and the expected result.

## Benchmarking

Go also provides support for benchmarking, allowing you to measure the performance of your code. Benchmark functions must start with the prefix `Benchmark` and take a pointer to `testing.B`.

### Example: Benchmarking a Function

```go
package mathutil

import "testing"

// BenchmarkAdd benchmarks the Add function
func BenchmarkAdd(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        Add(2, 3)
    }
}
```

In this example, the `BenchmarkAdd` function benchmarks the `Add` function by calling it in a loop. The `b.N` value is automatically adjusted by the testing framework to determine how many iterations to run for accurate timing.

### Running Benchmarks

To run benchmarks, use the following command:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

This command will run all benchmarks in the current package and display the results.

## Organizing Tests

It's a good practice to organize your tests in a way that makes them easy to find and maintain. Here are some tips for organizing tests in Go:

1. **Separate Test Files**: Place your test functions in files ending with `_test.go`. This helps the Go toolchain identify them as test files.

2. **Group Related Tests**: Group related tests together in the same file. For example, if you have multiple functions in a package, consider placing their tests in a single test file.

3. **Use Subtests**: You can use subtests to group related test cases within a single test function. This is useful for organizing tests that share setup code.

### Example: Using Subtests

```go
package mathutil

import "testing"

// TestOperations tests multiple operations using subtests
func TestOperations(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        a, b    int
        addExpected int
        mulExpected int
    }{
        {"Add and Multiply", 2, 3, 5, 6},
        {"Add and Multiply with zero", 0, 10, 10, 0},
        {"Add and Multiply with negative", -1, 1, 0, -1},
    }

    for _, test := range tests {
        t.Run(test.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            if result := Add(test.a, test.b); result != test.addExpected {
                t.Errorf("Add(%d, %d) = %d; want %d", test.a, test.b, result, test.addExpected)
            }
            if result := Multiply(test.a, test.b); result != test.mulExpected {
                t.Errorf("Multiply(%d, %d) = %d; want %d", test.a, test.b, result, test.mulExpected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

In this example, the `TestOperations` function uses subtests to group tests for both the `Add` and `Multiply` functions. Each subtest is named and runs independently, making it easier to identify which test case failed.

## Exercises

1. Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number and create a test for it using table-driven tests.

2. Implement a function that checks if a string is a palindrome and write tests to verify its correctness.

3. Create a benchmark for a function that sorts a slice of integers and analyze the performance.

4. Write a function that finds the maximum value in a slice of integers and test it using subtests.

5. Implement a function that reverses a string and create tests to ensure it works for various cases, including edge cases.
