# Functions in Go

## Introduction

Functions are the building blocks of Go programs. They allow you to encapsulate code into reusable units, making your programs more organized, modular, and easier to maintain. In Go, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. This tutorial will cover the fundamentals of functions in Go, including how to define, call, and use them effectively, along with advanced concepts such as variadic functions, closures, recursion, and the `defer` statement.

## Defining Functions

In Go, a function is defined using the `func` keyword, followed by the function name, parameters, return types, and the function body. The basic syntax for defining a function is as follows:

### Basic Function Syntax

```go
func functionName(parameter1 type1, parameter2 type2) returnType {
    // function body
    return value
}
```

### Example: A Simple Function

Letâ€™s start with a simple function that adds two integers:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Add returns the sum of two integers
func Add(a int, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

func main() {
    result := Add(3, 5)
    fmt.Println("Sum:", result) // Output: Sum: 8
}
```

In this example:
- We define a function named `Add` that takes two parameters of type `int`.
- The function returns their sum as an `int`.
- The `main` function calls `Add` and prints the result.

---

## Function Parameters

Functions can take multiple parameters, and you can specify the type for each parameter. If multiple parameters share the same type, you can declare them in a single line.

### Example: Multiple Parameters

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Multiply returns the product of two integers
func Multiply(x, y int) int {
    return x * y
}

func main() {
    result := Multiply(4, 5)
    fmt.Println("Product:", result) // Output: Product: 20
}
```

In this example:
- The `Multiply` function takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, both of type `int`.
- It returns their product.

---

## Return Values

Functions can return multiple values. You can specify the return types in parentheses. This feature is particularly useful for functions that need to return both a result and an error.

### Example: Multiple Return Values

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Divide returns the quotient and remainder of two integers
func Divide(a, b int) (int, int) {
    return a / b, a % b
}

func main() {
    quotient, remainder := Divide(10, 3)
    fmt.Println("Quotient:", quotient)   // Output: Quotient: 3
    fmt.Println("Remainder:", remainder) // Output: Remainder: 1
}
```

In this example:
- The `Divide` function returns both the quotient and the remainder of the division operation.

---

## Named Return Values

You can name the return values in a function signature. This allows you to return values without explicitly using the `return` statement. Named return values can improve code readability.

### Example: Named Return Values

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Calculate returns the sum and product of two integers
func Calculate(a, b int) (sum int, product int) {
    sum = a + b
    product = a * b
    return // Returns sum and product
}

func main() {
    s, p := Calculate(3, 4)
    fmt.Println("Sum:", s)       // Output: Sum: 7
    fmt.Println("Product:", p)   // Output: Product: 12
}
```

In this example:
- The `Calculate` function has named return values, making it clear what each return value represents.

---

## Variadic Functions

Variadic functions can accept a variable number of arguments. You can define a variadic function by using `...` before the parameter type. This is useful when you want to pass a list of values to a function.

### Example: Variadic Function

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Sum returns the sum of all integers passed as arguments
func Sum(numbers ...int) int {
    total := 0
    for _, number := range numbers {
        total += number
    }
    return total
}

func main() {
    result := Sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    fmt.Println("Total Sum:", result) // Output: Total Sum: 15
}
```

In this example:
- The `Sum` function takes a variable number of integer arguments and returns their total.

---

## Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions are functions that are defined without a name. They can be assigned to variables and passed as arguments to other functions. This feature is useful for creating quick, one-off functions.

### Example: Anonymous Function

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Define an anonymous function
    greet := func(name string) {
        fmt.Println("Hello,", name)
    }

    // Call the anonymous function
    greet("Alice") // Output: Hello, Alice
}
```

In this example:
- We define an anonymous function that greets a person by name and assign it to the variable `greet`.

---

## Closures

A closure is an anonymous function that captures and remembers the variables from its surrounding context. This allows the function to access those variables even after they go out of scope.

### Example: Closure

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Create a closure
    counter := func() func() int {
        count := 0
        return func() int {
            count++
            return count
        }
    }()

    // Call the closure
    fmt.Println(counter()) // Output: 1
    fmt.Println(counter()) // Output: 2
    fmt.Println(counter()) // Output: 3
}
```

In this example:
- The `counter` function returns another function that increments and returns the `count` variable.
- Each call to the returned function retains access to the `count` variable.

---

## Recursion

A function can call itself, which is known as recursion. Recursive functions must have a base case to avoid infinite loops. Recursion is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.

### Example: Recursive Function

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Factorial returns the factorial of n
func Factorial(n int) int {
    if n == 0 {
        return 1 // Base case
    }
    return n * Factorial(n-1) // Recursive case
}

func main() {
    result := Factorial(5)
    fmt.Println("Factorial of 5:", result) // Output: Factorial of 5: 120
}
```

In this example:
- The `Factorial` function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.

---

## Defer Statement

The `defer` statement is used to ensure that a function call is performed later in the program's execution, usually for cleanup purposes. Deferred calls are executed in LIFO (Last In, First Out) order.

### Example: Using Defer

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    defer fmt.Println("This will be printed last")
    fmt.Println("This will be printed first")
}
```

In this example:
- The deferred function call to `fmt.Println` is executed after the surrounding function (`main`) completes.

## Exercises

1. **Sum and Average**: Write a function that takes a slice of integers and returns the sum, average, minimum, and maximum values.

2. **Prime Checker**: Create a function that checks if a number is prime.

3. **Remove Vowels**: Implement a function that takes a string and returns a new string with all vowels removed.

4. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Write a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

5. **Higher-Order Function**: Create a higher-order function that takes a slice of integers and a function, applies the function to each element, and returns a new slice with the results.

6. **Unique ID Generator**: Implement a closure that generates a sequence of unique IDs.
