# Error Handling in Go

## Introduction

Error handling is a critical aspect of programming, and Go adopts a unique approach to managing errors. Unlike many languages that use exceptions, Go treats errors as values. This tutorial will explore the principles of error handling in Go, including how to return and check for errors, the use of the `error` type, creating custom error types, and best practices for effective error management.

## Understanding Errors in Go

In Go, errors are represented as values of the built-in `error` type, which is an interface. When a function encounters an error, it can return an error value along with the result. The calling function is responsible for checking the error and handling it appropriately.

### The `error` Type

The `error` type is defined as follows:

```go
type error interface {
    Error() string
}
```

Any type that implements the `Error()` method satisfies the `error` interface. This allows you to create custom error types if needed.

## Returning Errors

When writing functions that can fail, it is common to return an error as the last return value. If the function succeeds, it returns a `nil` error; if it fails, it returns an error value describing the failure.

### Example: Returning an Error

```go
package main

import (
    "errors"
    "fmt"
)

// Divide performs division and returns an error if the divisor is zero
func Divide(a, b float64) (float64, error) {
    if b == 0 {
        return 0, errors.New("division by zero")
    }
    return a / b, nil
}

func main() {
    result, err := Divide(10, 0)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err) // Output: Error: division by zero
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Result:", result)
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Divide` function checks if the divisor is zero. If it is, it returns an error using `errors.New()`. The calling function checks the error and handles it accordingly.

## Checking for Errors

When calling a function that returns an error, you should always check the error value. If the error is not `nil`, it indicates that something went wrong, and you should handle it appropriately.

### Example: Checking for Errors

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

// ReadFile simulates reading a file and returns an error if it fails
func ReadFile(filename string) (string, error) {
    if filename == "" {
        return "", errors.New("filename cannot be empty")
    }
    // Simulate successful file read
    return "File content", nil
}

func main() {
    content, err := ReadFile("")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err) // Output: Error: filename cannot be empty
    } else {
        fmt.Println("File Content:", content)
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ReadFile` function checks if the filename is empty and returns an error if it is. The `main` function checks for the error and prints an appropriate message.

## Custom Error Types

You can create custom error types by defining a struct that implements the `error` interface. This allows you to provide more context about the error, such as error codes or additional information.

### Example: Custom Error Type

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

// CustomError is a custom error type
type CustomError struct {
    Code    int
    Message string
}

// Error implements the error interface
func (e *CustomError) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("Error %d: %s", e.Code, e.Message)
}

// DoSomething simulates an operation that can fail
func DoSomething() error {
    return &CustomError{Code: 404, Message: "resource not found"}
}

func main() {
    err := DoSomething()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err) // Output: Error 404: resource not found
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a `CustomError` struct that includes an error code and message. The `Error()` method formats the error message, providing more context when the error occurs.

## Best Practices for Error Handling

1. **Check Errors Immediately**: Always check for errors immediately after calling a function that returns an error. This helps to ensure that you handle errors as soon as they occur.

2. **Provide Context**: When returning errors, provide context about what went wrong. This can help with debugging and understanding the issue.

3. **Use Custom Errors**: Consider using custom error types for more complex applications. This allows you to include additional information about the error, such as error codes or specific messages.

4. **Avoid Silent Failures**: Do not ignore errors. Always handle them appropriately to avoid silent failures in your application. Ignoring errors can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging difficult.

5. **Log Errors**: In production applications, consider logging errors for later analysis. This can help you identify and fix issues more effectively. Use logging libraries to capture error details, including timestamps and stack traces.

6. **Wrap Errors**: When returning errors from one function to another, consider wrapping them with additional context using the `fmt.Errorf` function. This allows you to retain the original error while providing more information about where the error occurred.

### Example: Wrapping Errors

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

// OpenFile attempts to open a file and returns an error if it fails
func OpenFile(filename string) error {
    _, err := os.Open(filename)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to open file %s: %w", filename, err)
    }
    return nil
}

func main() {
    err := OpenFile("nonexistent.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err) // Output: failed to open file nonexistent.txt: open nonexistent.txt: no such file or directory
    }
}
```

In this example, the `OpenFile` function wraps the error returned by `os.Open` with additional context, making it clear where the error occurred.

## Exercises

1. **File Reading**: Write a function that reads a number from a file and returns an error if the file does not exist or if the content is not a valid number. Handle the error appropriately in the main function.

2. **Custom Error Type**: Create a custom error type that includes a timestamp of when the error occurred. Implement a function that returns this error type when a specific condition is met.

3. **Database Connection**: Implement a function that connects to a database and returns an error if the connection fails. Use a custom error type to provide more context about the failure.

4. **Network Request**: Write a function that performs a network request and returns an error if the request fails. Handle the error in the main function and log it appropriately.

5. **Multiple Operations**: Create a program that simulates multiple operations, each returning an error, and handles them appropriately. Use wrapping to provide context for each error.
